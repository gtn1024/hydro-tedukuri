<h2>Description</h2><p><div><p>To play against the threats of malicious countries nearby, Country R has updated their missile defence system. The new type system can bring down a series of missiles as long as they are coming in ascending order by altitude or descending order by altitude.</p><p>Given the heights of a sequence of coming missiles, the general wants to know how many sets of the new type systems are needed to bring down all of them.</p></div></p><h2>Input</h2><p><p>The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer <i>n</i>(1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 50). The next line contains<i> n</i> different integers indicating the heights. </p></p><h2>Output</h2><p><p>For each test case output a single line containing the number of systems needed.</p></p>

<pre><code class="language-input1">5
3 5 2 4 1
0 </code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-output1">2</code></pre>

<h2>Hint</h2><p><p>Two sets of systems are needed for the sample. One brings down 3, 4 and the other brings down 5, 2, 1. </p></p><h2>Source</h2><p>POJ Founder Monthly Contest – 2008.10.05, facer</p>

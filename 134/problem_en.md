<h2>Description</h2><p>Longge is good at mathematics and he likes to think about hard mathematical problems which will be solved by some graceful algorithms. Now a problem comes: Given an integer N(1 &lt; N &lt; 2^31),you are to calculate   ∑gcd(i, N) 1&lt;=i &lt;=N.</p><p>"Oh, I know, I know!" Longge shouts! But do you know? Please solve it.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Input contain several test case.</p><p>A number N per line.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each N, output ,∑gcd(i, N) 1&lt;=i &lt;=N, a line</p>
